## Doing More with Multiple Columns using `tidyselect`

You probably are familiar with doing operations on *rows* (such as `filter`) and on single *columns* (using `mutate`). 

However, a very common use pattern is doing something with *multiple* columns in the data. And the `tidyselect` verbs help you with this. 

Let's look at a couple common patterns for using `tidyselect` in your `dplyr` recipes.

### Learning Objectives

- **Understand** how `tidyselect` helper functions (`contains()`, `all_of()`) work with `select()`.
- **Understand** how `where()` works with `select` and `.is*` functions
- **Learn** how to combine helpers with `c()` and find the *complement* using `-`
- **Apply** `across()` to work with `mutate()` to mutate multiple columns
- **Apply** `across()` with `summarize()` to summarize multiple columns


## `tidyselect` selection helpers

At the heart of `tidyselect` are the *selection helpers*. These let you select variables in a dataset to do operations on, such as `summarize()` or `mutate`.

- `everything()`
- `starts_with()`
- `ends_with()`
- `contains()`
- `any_of()`
- `where()`

We'll see that `where()` is a special case.

Here's a couple of useful things you can do with this.

### `penguins` overview

Here's the `penguins` data for reference:

```{r}
penguins
```


### `contains()`

Select all variables that contain "bill":

```{r bill, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
    select(contains("bill"))
```

### `all_of()`

`all_of()` is a strict selector. This statement won't work because `blah` is not a column name in `penguins`:

```{r allof, exercise=TRUE}
selected_variables <- c("island", "year", "species", "blah")

penguins %>%
  select(all_of(selected_variables))
```

This will work:

```{r allof2, exercise=TRUE}
selected_variables <- c("island", "year", "species")

penguins %>%
  select(all_of(selected_variables))
```

What can you use `all_of()` for? If you have a vector or column names, you can use `all_of()` to select and automate a process for those columns.

### `any_of()`

`any_of()` is more permissive that `all_of()`. I have a list of variables in a `character` vector and I want to select them. I can use `any_of()`:

```{r any_of, exercise=TRUE}
selected_variables <- c("island", "year", "species", "blah")

penguins %>%
  select(any_of(selected_variables))
```

### `where()` a wrapper for `is.*` functions

If you want to use a function like `is.integer` to select columns, you'll need to wrap it in a `where()`. 

```{r where1, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  select(where(is.integer))
```

### Exercise

Select the columns in `penguins` that are `factor`s.

```{r where2, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  select(where(is.factor))
```

### Another use for `where()` 

`where()` can be used with any logical function that can return a `TRUE/FALSE` for an entire vector. 

Note we have to test whether the column is numeric before we can use `mean(.x) > 20` as a criteria, because this expression doesn't work for non-`numeric` vectors.

```{r both, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  tidyr::drop_na() %>%
  select(where(~ is.numeric(.x) && mean(.x) > 20))
```

## More Useful things to do with `tidyselect` helpers

### Combining Multiple Helpers

You can use `c()` to combine multiple helpers:

```{r cc, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  select(c(species, contains("bill")))
```

### Using `-` with helpers

You can use the `-` operator to return everything but the helper:

```{r cc2, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  select(-contains("bill"))
```


## Use `mutate(across())` to do something to multiple columns

`across()` is a function in `dplyr` 1.0 that lets you specify a set of columns that uses a set of criteria. If there is one pattern that makes your life easier, it is `across`.

### Convert all character vectors to factors in a dataframe

The basic syntax:

```
mutate(
  across(
    where(is.character), as.factor
  )
)
```

```{r mutaccwhere, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
   mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character))
```

### Exercise:

Use `mutate(across())` to change everything that is a `integer` in `penguins` to a `double` using `as.double()`. 

```{r mut_across, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
penguins %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
```

```{r mut_across-solution}
penguins %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.integer), as.double))
```

### Exercise:

Use `mutate(across())` to convert the Likert scale columns to `ordered` factors.

```{r}
gap[1:10,]
```


```{r gap1, exercise=TRUE}
gap %>%
  mutate(StudentId = as.character(StudentId)) %>%
  mutate(across(is.integer, ordered))

```

## `summarize(across())`

Building on what we've learned, we can use `across()` in `summarize()` to summarize multiple variables.

```{r sum1, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(across(contains("bill"), mean, na.rm=TRUE))
```

This becomes especially useful when combined with `where`:

```{r sum2, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.double), mean, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Other verbs that have `cols` arguments

### `tidyr::pivot_longer()`

Another application that you might have not thought of is using `tidyselect` in `pivot_longer`. 

Using `pivot_longer()` with variables that have "bill" in them. 

```{r pivlong, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  pivot_longer(contains("bill"), names_to="metric", values_to="value")
```

Using `pivot_longer()` with variables that are `numeric`:

```{r pivlong2, exercise=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  pivot_longer(where(is.numeric), names_to="metric",
               values_to="value")
```
